A datablock gives it all the details to know the computer vision models

dalle2 came out in 2022 to generate pictures

Neural networks do all the hard work, we dont give it features, we tell it to learn features.

A feature is something that your model can learn from, ex: size of a house input with the price output, ur size is your feature

Can start with a random NN, then it can try to classify based off of the features.

The deeper you get, the more sophisticated the feature detection gets.
1. Angles, edges, circles,
2. Peoples, trees, flowers, animals (This is done by feature detection the flower edges, circles, stems)
3. types of flowers, types of dogs (done by classsifying the dogs nose, the dogs ears etc)

All of this is learned by the NN, not hand coded. 

fastai is a library on top of pytorch, use less code bc its better

Datablock, there are 5 things that it can be split in
1. input
2. output
3. A validation set, putting out some data so we can validate our data
4. Returns a parent folder in the path
5. Need all the input ot bee the same size, so resize ex: 192x192

will feed a batch of data, a group of data that will be passed in the model.

A learner is how it will train the data, you have to pass it 
1. The data loader object, dls
2. The model which is the neural network function that is being passed in ex: resnet18 (someone has made these weights available for us) 
3.  the fine_tune method which fine_tunes the data

Then we can call .predict on it.
